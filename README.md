Puppet module to manage deploy keys, for use example in (git clone)/(vcsrepo) actions.

Goal: Store your private keys for secure deploys, avoiding unsafe ssh connections with user/password.
<br />
##Example 1: Basic Usage
By default your keys will be stored in schema:
`"/etc/puppet/.deploy_keys/<username>/<my_deploy_key>"`
```puppet
class { "deploy_keys":
  key_name     => "my_deploy_key",
  source       => "puppet:///files/.../my_deploy_key",
  user         => "root"
}
```
##Example 2: Defining different base folder in same schema
If you wish, is possible store your keys in other folder, but in the same schema:<br />
`"/path/to/my/other/folder/<username>/<my_deploy_key>"`
```puppet
class { "deploy_keys":
  key_name     => "my_deploy_key",
  source       => "puppet:///files/.../my_deploy_key",
  user         => "root",
  base_folder  => "/path/to/my/other/folder",
}
```
##Example 3: Define the specific folder to key 
To the final example, your keys will be stored simply in `"/root/.ssh/id_rsa"`
```puppet
class { "deploy_keys":
  key_name     => "my_deploy_key",
  source       => "puppet:///files/.../my_deploy_key",
  user         => "root",
  key_dest     => "/root/.ssh/id_rsa"
}
```
